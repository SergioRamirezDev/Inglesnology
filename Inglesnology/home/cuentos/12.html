<div class="titulo">Aesop's Fables: The Swallow and the Other Birds
</div><p class="st">It happened that a Countryman was <a onmouseover="st(0);" onmouseout="ht();">sowing</a> some <a onmouseover="st(1);" onmouseout="ht();">hemp seeds</a> in a field where a <a onmouseover="st(2);" onmouseout="ht();">Swallow</a> and some other birds were <a onmouseover="st(3);" onmouseout="ht();">hopping about</a> picking up their food.  "Beware of that man," <a onmouseover="st(4);" onmouseout="ht();">quoth</a> the Swallow.
"Why, what is he doing?" said the others.  "That is hemp seed he is sowing; be careful to pick up every one of the seeds, or else you will repent it."<br>
<br>
The birds <a onmouseover="st(5);" onmouseout="ht();">paid no heed</a> to the Swallow's words, and by and by the hemp grew up and was made into <a onmouseover="st(6);" onmouseout="ht();">cord</a>, and
of the cords nets were made, and many a bird that had despised the Swallow's advice was caught in nets made out of that very hemp. "What did I tell you?" said the Swallow.<br>
<br>
Destroy the seed of <a onmouseover="st(7);" onmouseout="ht();">evil</a>, or it will grow up to your ruin.</p>
