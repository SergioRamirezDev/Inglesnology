<div class="titulo">Aesop's Fables: The Dog and the Shadow</div><p class="st">It happened that a Dog had got a piece of meat and was carrying it home in his mouth to eat it in peace.  Now, on his way home he had to cross a <a onmouseover="st(0);" onmouseout="ht();">plank</a> lying across a running <a onmouseover="st(1);" onmouseout="ht();">brook</a>.  As he
crossed, he looked down and saw his own shadow reflected in the water beneath.  Thinking it was another dog with another piece of meat, he <a onmouseover="st(2);" onmouseout="ht();">made up his mind</a> to have that also.  So he <a onmouseover="st(3);" onmouseout="ht();">made a snap</a> at the shadow in the water, but as he opened his mouth the piece of
meat fell out, dropped into the water and was never seen more.<br>
<br>
<a onmouseover="st(4);" onmouseout="ht();">Beware</a> <a onmouseover="st(5);" onmouseout="ht();">lest</a> you lose the substance by grasping at the shadow.</p>
