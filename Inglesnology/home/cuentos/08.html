<div class="titulo">Aesop's Fables: The Fox and the Crow
</div><p class="st">A Fox once saw a Crow fly off with a piece of cheese in its <a onmouseover="st(0);" onmouseout="ht();">beak</a> and <a onmouseover="st(1);" onmouseout="ht();">settle</a> on a branch of a tree.  "That's for me, as I am a Fox," said Master Reynard, and he walked up to the foot of the
tree. "Good-day, Mistress Crow," he cried. "How well you are looking to-day: how <a onmouseover="st(2);" onmouseout="ht();">glossy</a> your <a onmouseover="st(3);" onmouseout="ht();">feathers</a>; how bright your eye. I feel sure your voice must <a onmouseover="st(4);" onmouseout="ht();">surpass</a> that of other birds, just as your figure does; let me hear but one song from you that I may
greet you as the Queen of Birds."<br>
<br>
The Crow lifted up her head and began to <a onmouseover="st(5);" onmouseout="ht();">caw</a> her best, but the moment she opened her mouth the piece of cheese fell to the ground, only to be <a onmouseover="st(6);" onmouseout="ht();">snapped up</a> by Master Fox. "That will do," said he. "That was all I wanted.  In
exchange for your cheese I will give you a piece of advice for the future.<br>
