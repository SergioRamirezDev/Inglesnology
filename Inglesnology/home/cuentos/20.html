<div class="titulo">Aesop's Fables: The Fox and the Mask
</div><p class="st">A Fox had by some means got into the <a onmouseover="st(0);" onmouseout="ht();">store-room</a> of a theatre. Suddenly he observed a face <a onmouseover="st(1);" onmouseout="ht();">glaring</a> down on him and began to be very frightened; but looking more closely he found it was only a
Mask such as actors use to put over their face. "Ah," said the Fox, "you look very fine; it is a pity you have not got any brains."<br>
<br>
Outside show is a poor substitute for inner <a onmouseover="st(2);" onmouseout="ht();">worth</a>.</p>
