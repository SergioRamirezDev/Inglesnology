<div class="titulo">Aesop's Fables: The Sick Lion
</div><p class="st">A Lion had come to the end of his days and <a onmouseover="st(0);" onmouseout="ht();">lay</a> sick unto death at the mouth of his cave, <a onmouseover="st(1);" onmouseout="ht();">gasping</a> for breath.  The animals, his subjects, came round him and <a onmouseover="st(2);" onmouseout="ht();">drew nearer</a> as he grew more and more
<a onmouseover="st(3);" onmouseout="ht();">helpless</a>.<br>
<br>
When they saw him on the point of death they thought to themselves: "Now is the time to <a onmouseover="st(4);" onmouseout="ht();">pay off</a> old <a onmouseover="st(5);" onmouseout="ht();">grudges</a>."  So the Boar came up and drove at him with his <a onmouseover="st(6);" onmouseout="ht();">tusks</a>; then a Bull <a onmouseover="st(7);" onmouseout="ht();">gored</a> him with his horns; still the Lion lay helpless before them: so the
Ass, feeling quite safe from danger, came up, and turning his tail to the Lion kicked up his <a onmouseover="st(8);" onmouseout="ht();">heels</a> into his face.  "This is a double death," growled the Lion.<br>
<br>
Only cowards insult dying majesty.</p>
