<div class="titulo">Aesop's Fables: The Jay and the Peacock
</div><p class="st">A Jay venturing into a yard where Peacocks used to walk, found there a number of <a onmouseover="st(0);" onmouseout="ht();">feathers</a> which had fallen from the Peacocks when they were <a onmouseover="st(1);" onmouseout="ht();">moulting</a>. He tied them all to his tail and <a onmouseover="st(2);" onmouseout="ht();">strutted
</a>down towards the Peacocks. When he came near them they soon discovered the cheat, and <a onmouseover="st(3);" onmouseout="ht();">striding</a> up to him <a onmouseover="st(4);" onmouseout="ht();">pecked</a> at him and <a onmouseover="st(5);" onmouseout="ht();">plucked away</a> his <a onmouseover="st(6);" onmouseout="ht();">borrowed</a> plumes. So the Jay could do no better than go back to the other Jays, who had watched his behaviour from
a distance; but they were equally annoyed with him, and told him:<br>
<br>
"It is not only fine feathers that make fine birds."</p>
