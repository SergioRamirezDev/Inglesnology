<div class="titulo">Aesop's Fables: The Frog and the Ox
</div><p class="st">"Oh Father," said a little Frog to the big one sitting by the side of a pool, "I have seen such a terrible monster! It was as big as a mountain, with <a onmouseover="st(0);" onmouseout="ht();">horns</a> on its head, and a long tail, and it
had <a onmouseover="st(1);" onmouseout="ht();">hoofs</a> divided in two."<br>
<br>
"<a onmouseover="st(2);" onmouseout="ht();">Tush</a>, child, tush," said the old Frog, "that was only Farmer White's Ox. It isn't so big either; he may be a little bit taller than I, but I could easily make myself quite as broad; just you see." So he blew himself out, and blew himself out, and blew
himself out. "Was he as big as that?" asked he.<br>
<br>
"Oh, much bigger than that," said the young Frog.<br>
<br>
Again the old one blew himself out, and asked the young one if the Ox was as big as that.<br>
<br>
"Bigger, father, bigger," was the reply.<br>
<br>
So the Frog took a deep breath, and blew and blew and blew, and <a onmouseover="st(3);" onmouseout="ht();">swelled</a> and swelled and swelled. And then he said: "I'm sure the Ox is not as big as this. But at this moment he burst.<br>
<br>
<a onmouseover="st(4);" onmouseout="ht();">Self-conceit</a> may <a onmouseover="st(5);" onmouseout="ht();">lead</a> to self-destruction.</p>
