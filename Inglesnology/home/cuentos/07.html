<div class="titulo">Aesop's Fables: The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse</div><p class="st">Now you must know that a Town Mouse once upon a time went on a visit to his cousin in the country.  He was <a onmouseover="st(0);" onmouseout="ht();">rough and ready</a>, this cousin, but he loved his town friend and made him heartily
welcome. Beans and bacon, cheese and bread, were all he had to offer, but he offered them freely.<br>
<br>
The Town Mouse rather <a onmouseover="st(1);" onmouseout="ht();">turned up his long nose</a> at this country <a onmouseover="st(2);" onmouseout="ht();">fare</a>, and said: "I cannot understand, Cousin, how you can <a onmouseover="st(3);" onmouseout="ht();">put up with</a> such poor food as this, but of course you cannot expect anything better in the
country; come you with me and I will show you how to live. When you have been in town a week you will wonder how you could ever have <a onmouseover="st(4);" onmouseout="ht();">stood</a> a country life."<br>
<br>
No sooner said than done: the two mice set off for the town and arrived at the Town Mouse's residence late at night.  "You will want some refreshment after our long journey," said the polite Town Mouse, and took his friend
into the grand dining-room. There they found the <a onmouseover="st(5);" onmouseout="ht();">remains</a> of a fine feast, and soon the two mice were eating up jellies and cakes and all that was nice.<br>
<br>
Suddenly they heard <a onmouseover="st(6);" onmouseout="ht();">growling</a> and <a onmouseover="st(7);" onmouseout="ht();">barking</a>. "What is that?" said the Country Mouse. "It is only the dogs of the house," answered the other.  "Only!" said the Country Mouse. "I do not like that music at my dinner." Just at that moment the
door <a onmouseover="st(8);" onmouseout="ht();">flew open</a>, in came two huge <a onmouseover="st(9);" onmouseout="ht();">mastiffs</a>, and the two mice had to <a onmouseover="st(10);" onmouseout="ht();">scamper down</a> and <a onmouseover="st(11);" onmouseout="ht();">run off</a>. "Good-bye, Cousin," said the Country Mouse, "What! going so soon?" said the other. "Yes," he replied;<br>
<br>
"Better beans and bacon in peace than cakes and ale in fear."</p>
