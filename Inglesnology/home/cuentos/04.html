<div class="titulo">Aesop's Fables: The Lion's Share</div><p class="st">The Lion went once a-hunting along with the Fox, the Jackal, and the Wolf.  They hunted and they hunted till at last they surprised a Stag, and soon took its life.  Then came the question
how the <a onmouseover="st(0);" onmouseout="ht();">spoil</a> should be divided. "<a onmouseover="st(1);" onmouseout="ht();">Quarter</a> me this Stag," <a onmouseover="st(2);" onmouseout="ht();">roared</a> the Lion; so the other animals skinned it and cut it into four parts.<br>
<br>
Then the Lion took his stand in front of the <a onmouseover="st(3);" onmouseout="ht();">carcass</a> and pronounced judgment:  The first quarter is for me in my capacity as King of Beasts; the second is mine as arbiter; another share comes to me for my part in the chase; and as for the fourth
quarter, well, as for that, I should like to see which of you will <a onmouseover="st(4);" onmouseout="ht();">dare</a> to lay a <a onmouseover="st(5);" onmouseout="ht();">paw</a> upon it."<br>
<br>
"Humph," <a onmouseover="st(6);" onmouseout="ht();">grumbled</a> the Fox as he walked away with his tail between his legs; but he spoke in a low <a onmouseover="st(7);" onmouseout="ht();">growl</a>. "You may share the labours of the great, but you will not share the spoil."</p>
