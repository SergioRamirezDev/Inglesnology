<div class="titulo">Aesop's Fables: The Wolf and the Lamb</div><p class="st">Once upon a time a Wolf was <a onmouseover="st(0);" onmouseout="ht();">lapping</a> at a spring on a hillside, when, looking up, what should he see but a Lamb just beginning to drink a little lower down.  "There's my supper," thought he, "if
only I can find some excuse to <a onmouseover="st(1);" onmouseout="ht();">seize</a> it."  Then he called out to the Lamb, "How dare you <a onmouseover="st(2);" onmouseout="ht();">muddle</a> the water from which I am drinking?"<br>
<br>
"<a onmouseover="st(3);" onmouseout="ht();">Nay</a>, master, nay," said Lambikin; "if the water be muddy up there, I cannot be the cause of it, for it runs down from you to me."<br>
<br>
"Well, then," said the Wolf, "why did you call me bad names this time last year?"<br>
<br>
"That cannot be," said the Lamb; "I am only six months old."<br>
<br>
"I don't care," <a onmouseover="st(4);" onmouseout="ht();">snarled</a> the Wolf; "if it was not you it was your father;" and with that he rushed upon the poor little Lamb and ate her all up. But before she died she gasped out:<br>
<br>
&quot;Any excuse will serve a tyrant."</p>
