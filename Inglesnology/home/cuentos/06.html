<div class="titulo">Aesop's Fables: The Man and the Serpent</div><p class="st">A Countryman's son by accident <a onmouseover="st(0);" onmouseout="ht();">trod upon</a> a Serpent's tail, which turned and <a onmouseover="st(1);" onmouseout="ht();">bit</a> him so that he died.  The father <a onmouseover="st(2);" onmouseout="ht();">in a rage</a> got his axe, and pursuing the Serpent, cut off part of its tail.
So the Serpent in revenge <a onmouseover="st(3);" onmouseout="ht();">began stinging</a> several of the Farmer's cattle and caused him severe <a onmouseover="st(4);" onmouseout="ht();">loss</a>.  Well, the Farmer thought it best <a onmouseover="st(5);" onmouseout="ht();">to make it up</a> with the Serpent, and brought food and honey to the mouth of its <a onmouseover="st(6);" onmouseout="ht();">lair</a>, and said to it: "Let's forget and <a onmouseover="st(7);" onmouseout="ht();">forgive</a>;
perhaps you were right to punish my son, and take vengeance on my <a onmouseover="st(8);" onmouseout="ht();">cattle</a>, but surely I was right in trying to revenge him; now that we are both satisfied why should not we be friends again?"<br>
<br>
"No, no," said the Serpent; "<a onmouseover="st(9);" onmouseout="ht();">take away</a> your gifts; you can never forget the death of your son, nor I the loss of my tail."<br>
<br>
<a onmouseover="st(10);" onmouseout="ht();">Injuries</a> may be forgiven, but not forgotten.</p>
