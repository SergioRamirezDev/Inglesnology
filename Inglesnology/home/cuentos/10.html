<div class="titulo">Aesop's Fables: The Ass and the Lapdog
</div><p class="st">A Farmer one day came to the stables to see to his <a onmouseover="st(0);" onmouseout="ht();">beasts of burden</a>: among them was his favourite Ass, that was always well <a onmouseover="st(1);" onmouseout="ht();">fed</a> and often carried his master.  With the Farmer came his <a onmouseover="st(2);" onmouseout="ht();">Lapdog</a>,
who danced about and <a onmouseover="st(3);" onmouseout="ht();">licked</a> his hand and <a onmouseover="st(4);" onmouseout="ht();">frisked about</a> as happy as could be. The Farmer felt in his pocket, gave the Lapdog some <a onmouseover="st(5);" onmouseout="ht();">dainty</a> food, and sat down while he gave his orders to his servants.  The Lapdog jumped into his master's lap, and lay there
<a onmouseover="st(6);" onmouseout="ht();">blinking</a> while the Farmer stroked his ears.<br>
<br>
The Ass, seeing this, <a onmouseover="st(7);" onmouseout="ht();">broke loose</a> from his <a onmouseover="st(8);" onmouseout="ht();">halter</a> and commenced <a onmouseover="st(9);" onmouseout="ht();">prancing about</a> in imitation of the Lapdog.  The Farmer could not hold his sides with laughter, so the Ass went up to him, and putting his feet upon the
Farmer's shoulder attempted to climb into his lap. The Farmer's servants <a onmouseover="st(10);" onmouseout="ht();">rushed up</a> with sticks and <a onmouseover="st(11);" onmouseout="ht();">pitchforks</a> and soon taught the Ass that:<br>
<br>
<a onmouseover="st(12);" onmouseout="ht();">Clumsy</a> <a onmouseover="st(13);" onmouseout="ht();">jesting</a> is no joke.</p>
