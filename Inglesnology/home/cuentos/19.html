<div class="titulo">Aesop's Fables: The Fox and the Stork
</div><p class="st">At one time the Fox and the Stork were on visiting terms and seemed very good friends. So the Fox invited the Stork to dinner, and for a joke put nothing before her but some soup in a very
<a onmouseover="st(0);" onmouseout="ht();">shallow</a> dish. This the Fox could easily <a onmouseover="st(1);" onmouseout="ht();">lap up</a>, but the Stork could only wet the end of her long <a onmouseover="st(2);" onmouseout="ht();">bill</a> in it, and left the meal as hungry as when she began.  "I am sorry," said the Fox, "the soup is not to your liking."<br>
<br>
"<a onmouseover="st(3);" onmouseout="ht();">Pray</a> do not <a onmouseover="st(4);" onmouseout="ht();">apologise</a>," said the Stork. "I hope you will return this visit, and come and dine with me soon." So a day was appointed when the Fox should visit the Stork; but when they were seated at table all that was for their dinner was contained in a
very <a onmouseover="st(5);" onmouseout="ht();">long-necked jar</a> with a narrow mouth, in which the Fox could not insert his <a onmouseover="st(6);" onmouseout="ht();">snout</a>, so all he could manage to do was to lick the outside of the jar.<br>
<br>
"I will not apologise for the dinner," said the Stork:<br>
<br>
"One bad turn deserves another."</p>
