<div class="titulo">Aesop's Fables: The Lion and the Mouse
</div><p class="st">Once when a Lion was asleep a little Mouse began running up and down upon him; this soon <a onmouseover="st(0);" onmouseout="ht();">wakened</a> the Lion, who placed his huge <a onmouseover="st(1);" onmouseout="ht();">paw</a> upon him, and opened his big <a onmouseover="st(2);" onmouseout="ht();">jaws</a> to swallow him. "Pardon, O
King," cried the little Mouse: "forgive me this time, I shall never forget it: who knows but what I may be able to do you a turn some of these days?"  The Lion was so tickled at the idea of the Mouse being able to help him, that he lifted up his paw and let
him go.  Some time after the Lion was caught in a trap, and the hunters who desired to carry him alive to the King, <a onmouseover="st(3);" onmouseout="ht();">tied</a> him to a tree while they went in search of a <a onmouseover="st(4);" onmouseout="ht();">wagon</a> to carry him on. Just then the little Mouse happened to pass by, and seeing the sad
<a onmouseover="st(5);" onmouseout="ht();">plight</a> in which the Lion was, went up to him and soon <a onmouseover="st(6);" onmouseout="ht();">gnawed away</a> the ropes that <a onmouseover="st(7);" onmouseout="ht();">bound</a> the King of the Beasts.  "Was I not right?" said the little Mouse.<br>
