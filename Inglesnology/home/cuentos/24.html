<div class="titulo">Aesop's Fables: The Bat, the Birds and the Beasts
</div><p class="st">A great conflict was about to come off between the Birds and the Beasts. When the two armies were collected together the Bat <a onmouseover="st(0);" onmouseout="ht();">hesitated</a> which to join. The Birds that passed his <a onmouseover="st(1);" onmouseout="ht();">perch</a> said:
"Come with us"; but he said: "I am a Beast." Later on, some Beasts who were passing underneath him looked up and said: "Come with us"; but he said: "I am a Bird."<br>
<br>
Luckily at the last moment peace was made, and no battle <a onmouseover="st(2);" onmouseout="ht();">took place</a>, so the Bat came to the
Birds and wished to join in the <a onmouseover="st(3);" onmouseout="ht();">rejoicings</a>, but they all turned against him and he had to fly away. He then went to the Beasts, but soon had to <a onmouseover="st(4);" onmouseout="ht();">beat a retreat</a>, or else they would have <a onmouseover="st(5);" onmouseout="ht();">torn</a> him <a onmouseover="st(5);" onmouseout="ht();">to pieces</a>. "Ah," said the Bat, "I see now,<br>
<br>
"He that is neither one thing nor the other has no friends."</p>
