<div class="titulo">Aesop's Fables: The Wolf and the Crane</div><p class="st">A Wolf had been <a onmouseover="st(0);" onmouseout="ht();">gorging on</a> an animal he had killed, when suddenly a small bone in the meat <a onmouseover="st(1);" onmouseout="ht();">stuck</a> in his throat and he could not <a onmouseover="st(2);" onmouseout="ht();">swallow</a> it.  He soon felt terrible pain in his throat, and ran
up and down <a onmouseover="st(3);" onmouseout="ht();">groaning</a> and groaning and seeking for something to relieve the pain.  He tried to induce every one he met to remove the bone.  "I would give anything," said he, "if you would take it out."  At last the Crane agreed to try, and told the Wolf to <a onmouseover="st(4);" onmouseout="ht();">lie</a>
on his side and open his <a onmouseover="st(5);" onmouseout="ht();">jaws</a> as wide as he could. Then the Crane put its long neck down the Wolf's throat, and with its <a onmouseover="st(6);" onmouseout="ht();">beak</a> <a onmouseover="st(7);" onmouseout="ht();">loosened</a> the bone, till at last it got it out.<br>
<br>
"Will you kindly give me the <a onmouseover="st(8);" onmouseout="ht();">reward</a> you promised?" said the Crane.<br>
<br>
The Wolf <a onmouseover="st(9);" onmouseout="ht();">grinned</a> and showed his teeth and said: "Be content. You have put your head inside a Wolf's mouth and taken it out again in safety; that ought to be reward enough for you."<br>
<br>
Gratitude and <a onmouseover="st(10);" onmouseout="ht();">greed</a> go not together.</p>
